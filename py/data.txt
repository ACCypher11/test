A DDoS (Distributed Denial-of-Service) attack 
is a cyberattack where attackers overwhelm a server, 
service, or network with a flood of malicious internet 
traffic, making it unavailable to legitimate users. 
This is done by using a network of compromised computers, 
or botnet, to send more requests than the target can handle, 
causing it to slow down or crash. 
The motivations for these attacks vary, 
including causing disruption, 
financial gain, extortion, or political reason
